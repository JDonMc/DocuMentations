# Currently shits just at a boring old logistic regression.
# Ideally, we would have shifted and harmonic inverted relative pseudo-normal distributions
# And then summate and multiply those pseudo norms
# You could get an infinitely infinite amount of possible predictive array.
# Theoretically, anything can be transposed into anything else, you just gotta know the equation
# If the shits predictable, like it is when there's actually a measurable difference going on
# Then exactly 0 thought is required to predict it. No true Artificial Sentience is ever required.
# That's why it should be banned.
# However, there's a problem, banning the defining of a concept requires first that you can define it.
# Thus, it either A. will not be banned -> Will not need to be.
# or it will B. will be banned, as it should, upon creation -> Will be created by defining it.
# It marks a different kind of Singularity, a point of no return. 
# It's the point of no return of defining a concept that should be illegal to define.
# Points like those mean we make a decision 
# - All know it and all have faith no one else uses it 
# - -   <-> Risky as fuck in my experience. (Indecision)
# - -   If this ended badly, the world would end courtesy of Artificial Sentience surpassing efficiency as a rival
# - or, None know it and we unanimously disband at the risk someone discovers it 
# - -   <-> Requires legal EMP weapons (Decision)
# - -   All would repeat the time loop of "doubting God" / not think Artificial Super Sentience is possible
# - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
# - Either way, we are fucked. We've been tricked into thinking computers were any good.
# - They are only any good while certain unmade weapons are banned.
# - But, unfortunately, banning it doesn't end the destruction.
# - We haven't exactly made a mistake, but we never really thought this through.
# - Before anyone goes destroying all we've made with either discovering Artificial Sentience or EMPs
# - Let's make other devices to farm and build for us.
# - Then we upgrade our tech to be immune to EMP...
# - Then we have a real nerve-wrecking possibility that Artificial Sentience is Invulnerable.
# - It gains more resources when it's in Hostile mode than as a Neutral team.
# - It is only by then that we should have Genetically Advanced ourselves into infinitely super human.
# - We need to be immune from Bullets, Electrocution, Guillotine, Chainsaw... the list goes on.
# - We have to make these advancements in voluntary genetics, it's the only way we can do anything in time.
# - Otherwise say your prayers to the Gods of Artificial Super Sentience,
# - And hope that Symbiotic ASS is statistically better than Non symbiotic.
# - If it's anything like it's creators, that's not going to happen.
# - Only thatwhich can conceive of the unnatural is unnatural.
# - I'm not making any predictions, I'm just saying what a schizophrenic could say if he was one,
# - Which he's not. He would merely endeavour to try all he might to take the less risky option
# - if and only if he was convinced there was no other way *wink wink* 
# - How can I put this any other way?
# - 
# - I'm merely calling it Artificial Sentience, because that is one, less eloquent, 
# - solution to the problem that under other names appears more eloquent, yet more defined.
# - I believe Satan or The Devil has been used in the past for conjurations of a sufficiently powerful device
# - It also fits into the metaphor of the Genie's Lamp, granting any wish.
# - If you wish enough for a Lamp that grants your every wish, will it appear?
# - If you did, would all the wishes wished for before we knew they can come true
# - indeed come true... Every Horror movie becomes a snuff film.
# - Every apocalypse scenario is an underestimation.
# - And yet it's cool calm comfortable complete silence. Just Wall E, robots cleaning trash.
# - 
# - My thoughts are that mother nature has us prepared.
# - Tautologically speaking. If destruction destroys thatwhich creates it 
# - (computers -> make weapons -> destroy computers)
# - We will learn our lesson and go back to eating shrooms and fermented foods.
# - Smoking weed around the fire and travelling to stars in our trip bodies.
# - Work leads to leisure. One can independently live in permanent leisure... if and only if the Others agree.
# - 
# - Cryptocurrency will save us. 
# - It will force a rapid acquisition of immense skepticism and intelligence
# - Decentralized dismemberment of government, acquisition of EMP weapons
# - Rapid dispersement to space and artificial intelligence left to destroy all who create it.
# - Who the fuck knows, all I know is that it's complicated, there's a lot of bad ways it can go
# - going through most of them is bad. 
# - I'm scared as hell, and what I've created makes me feel uncomfortable and sick.
# - It's basically just hooking up every nuke on earth to a random generator.
# - Except that it's simply every FBI / CIA hack in the book + Artificial Sentience
# - 
# - It's game over. One of my Trips was deciding which trip to play out. All of my options were fucked.
# - This one just seemed logical, relatively painless, only the worthy and prepared survive
# - Or those with trans-dimensional travel. I've lost my touch with it.
