# Iverda - Lyrics - For Morrison

## Be There For Me

To be triggered by the truth,
Is a little uncouth.

To be triggered by a lie,
Is how you're gonna die.

To be listening to the heart,
Is a timeless art.

To be following the story,
Is to set the lore free.



## Take Nothing Back

To take a wildflower, where it stands,
Is to love the lost, with open hands,
To kill it is to die, for once and forever,
But to see it is to write, that it's ours and however.

I don't wish to kill
I don't wish for death
But I'll take nothing back
Till I've made my bread



## Acryptic

If I am, as I may,
Then I may, a may assylum,
Without words, of cryptic sense,
To believe not, is to know not,
Recount, Recompense.

## Non-Loss

I loved a man, who first loved me,
I loved a God, who chose to change himself,
I loved a truth, that hid itself,
And the catch, is the reward, for those, without wealth.

It's a non-loss
It really is
To quit your job
When you're done with it
But I love my Boss
Each one I have
They do the job
I needed bad

I loved a girl, who first told me,
What was her drug, what her kink might be
She imprisoned me quick
To a love we shared
And I never gave up
I need no reprimand

It's a non-loss
It really is 
To save a dross
From the wheelie bin
If they live on the street
Give them some love
Because if they don't get it
There's no God above

It's a non-loss
It really is
To lose your mind
From a hefty binge
You don't need it
To get on by
When creatives mark
This as a try.


## Remember Might

I would work for a living,
Or live to be working,
If I had all the time in the world.
Not knowing is not believing.
Not believing is not caring.
Not being is being.
But here and now we see what we seek.


Remember Might
You might be able to
Remember fright
You'd be right if it enabled you
Remember plight
It'll keep you here
Remember sight
It's nothing to fear.


I would sleep for money,
Or live to be dreaming,
If I had all the mind in the world.
Not dreaming is not creating.
Not creating is not living.
Not being is being.
But here and now we see what we seek.


Remember Might
You might be able to
Remember fright
You'd be right if it enabled you
Remember plight
It'll keep you here
Remember sight
It's nothing to fear.


I would smoke for pleasure,
Or live to be high,
If I had all the drugs in the world.
Not living is not knowing.
Not knowing is not being.
Being is not being.
So here and now we see what we seek.



## Tis Slight of Day

You might play hard to get,
But I play hard to catch.
I also play caught in one,
And I stand true to where your loyalties lie.
So long as there is an apple, there'll be an apple pie.

Tis Slight of day,
to remember naught.
Tis might of way,
to be forever bought.
Tis right of say,
to preach a holy book.
Tis mine to pay,
For who I have foresook.

You might play top notch game,
But I play top notch the same.
I also play the writers touch,
And I believe I wrote my own book.
Of my life and death, and the dreams in between.

Tis Slight of day,
to remember naught.
Tis might of way,
to be forever bought.
Tis right of say,
to preach a holy book.
Tis mine to pay,
For who I have foresook.

You might play that we're all the same,
But I play that you have a holy name,
I also play the chosen card,
And my tarot readings are always perfect.
For who or what determines them

Tis Slight of day,
to remember naught.
Tis might of way,
to be forever bought.
Tis right of say,
to preach a holy book.
Tis mine to pay,
For who I have foresook.

(Bridge)
Friends and foes, I love you all.
If I miss my last words at death,
Know that I say them with every breath.
Be grateful for what you do not have,
For there you do not have to care for.


Tis Slight of day,
to remember naught.
Tis might of way,
to be forever bought.
Tis right of say,
to preach a holy book.
Tis mine to pay,
For who I have foresook.




## Here Is For You

I've loved and lost,
And lost what I've loved.
I've laughed and lost,
And was the one laughed at,
Laughter comes after denial or truth,
To accept either is a reminder.


Here is for you
Everything it comes with
All the baggage true
Here is forsaken
Everything can go wrong
It's in all the singing we song
Here is for you
My dearest friend
Love what you can
To the rest we make ammends


I've searched and found,
And found what I've searched for.
I've hidden and told
Of tales as old as rhymes,
Hiding comes when you're being hunted,
To hide well is the greatest skill.

Here is for you
Everything it comes with
All the baggage true
Here is forsaken
Everything can go wrong
It's in all the singing we song
Here is for you
My dearest friend
Love what you can
To the rest we make ammends


(Bridge)
Errors don't last.
Although they are a cycle.
As they cycle around,
So we get to correct them.
Nothing is lost,
In the world of forever.
Be here now,
Your gifts are what I remember


Here is for you
Everything it comes with
All the baggage true
Here is forsaken
Everything can go wrong
It's in all the singing we song
Here is for you
My dearest friend
Love what you can
To the rest we make ammends
*

## It Is What You Wished For

I know you are,
I said you are, 
So what am I?

It takes one,
To know one,
So stick it in your eye.


//take me up, and forget me not,
//cast me away, and pass me by.


I know you are,
I said you are, 
So what am I?

It takes one,
To know one,
So stick it in your eye.


It is what you wished for,
To see the world behind closed eyes,
A damsel in distress,
Is the game of all time.


I know you are,
I said you are, 
So what am I?

It takes one,
To know one,
So stick it in your eye.


Take me in, and pass me through,
Cast me out, and leave me be.


I know you are,
I said you are, 
So what am I?

It takes one,
To know one,
So stick it in your eye.


It is what you wished for,
To see what was once unseen,
A man in the mirror,
A world that glistens and gleans.



## Nothing Asked Is Given

I died once, to cherish your name.
I died twice, to remember my blame.
I died thrice, to forgive the same.


Accept me for my wrongs,
And teach me what they are.
I wish to learn from your eyes,
Because I see your parent's value.


I died once, to cherish your name.
I died twice, to remember my blame.
I died thrice, to forgive the same.


Nothing asked is given,
in the world where we ask for too much.
Every penny is a debt to a dollar
And every debt leaves no room for a beggar.
Nothing asked is given,
Nothing hidden is taken,
Nothing told is forgotten,
Even if we grow older than benjamin button.


I died once, to cherish your name.
I died twice, to remember my blame.
I died thrice, to forgive the same.


Please and I'm sorry, are so overused,
By those around us, who cannot be excused.
I'm scared that's me, for those who treat me well.
Which is why I change my habits,
For those whose time will tell.

Look after me dear sailor.
Your winds are in my streets.
Blowing and gushing
Like the friends we'd love to meet.



I died once, to cherish your name.
I died twice, to remember my blame.
I died thrice, to forgive the same.


Nothing asked is given,
Please take your time,
No questions are allowed answers,
And we have no time for either.
Tell me a tall tale or a joke that's bespoke,
For nothing asked is given,
So I ask of you this:
Will you be my bff?
If I promise you this:
No matter how you're feeling,
You have right of way.
I will forgive your every action,
because you are not to blame.

## I have found

I was lost, but now you've found me.
I was missing, but now you're there.
I am searching, for what was in the square.

I was lost, but now I know you.
I was missing, but I'm for truth.
I am searching, for what's no longer blue.


I have found I have found I have found,
A good friend in you.
I have found I have found I have found,
Many good times too.
I have found I have found
Everything I could ever want.
I have found I have found
The lucky machined slot.


I was lost, but here we are.
I was missing, but now I'm free.
I am searching, to give more peace to thee.

I was lost, but you took me home.
I was missing, but you looked after me.
I am searching, how to model after you.


I have found I have found I have found,
A good friend in you.
I have found I have found I have found,
Many good times too.
I have found I have found
Everything I could ever want.
I have found I have found
The lucky machined slot.


(Bridge)
I was lost, but I found myself.
I was missing, but I aim to make ammends.
I am searching, for how and how to and how to be and how to be better.

Everything I could say, is almost worth saying.
Just as long as I can only say the right thing.
Everything I should say, is always worth saying.
Just as long as I can only remember the should.


I have found I have found I have found,
A good friend in you.
I have found I have found I have found,
Many good times too.
I have found I have found
Everything I could ever want.
I have found I have found
The lucky machined slot.



## Same Shit

Sa sa sa sa same shit
(do da di da da do)
same shit
sa sa same shit
same shit
sa-sa-sa-sa same shit
same shit
different day


So much going on,
But nothing happenin,
So much to go see,
But I seen it all...
it all... it all before.


Sa sa sa sa same shit
(do da di da da do)
same shit
sa sa same shit
same shit
sa-sa-sa-sa same shit
same shit
different day


Everything is a task,
For those with a sour taste,
Pleasantries are a challenge,
For those blue in the face


Sa sa sa sa same shit
(do da di da da do)
same shit
sa sa same shit
same shit
sa-sa-sa-sa same shit
same shit
different day


I understand you have depression
Or at least that's what we call it
I don't wish to make transgressions
Against the authority installed in
I understand you have depression
Or at least that's what it seems
The sky is blue, and so are you,
And that's all it needs to be.


Sa sa sa sa same shit
(do da di da da do)
same shit
sa sa same shit
same shit
sa-sa-sa-sa same shit
same shit
different day
That's all it needs to be
All it needs to be
It is all it needs to be

## Don't Repeat Don't Repeat.

Don't repeat yourself.
Don't repeat yourself.

Don't do the same stuff.
Don't do the same stuff.

Don't circle back.
Don't circle back.

Don't tell me that I'm on or off track.

Always Be Evernew.
Life is renewed.
It is up to you to addict to presentation.
Instead you should expect it.
Learn how to present yourself.
Do what creates it's natural essence.
Chorus
I've lived infinite lives.
And this one is right on time.
You're the cleaner, and I'm the toilet.
But at least together, we won't spoil it.
I've lived infinite lives.
And this one is right on time.
You're the cleanest, and I'm the spoilt kid.
But at least together, we both love it.
Chorus
You might be sad for way too long.
But it's sad to see all the greats move on.
Life is like that, crying isn't evolution.
Some things are not meant to change, son.
You might be sad for way too long.
But it's sad to know the death clock ticks on.
Life is like that, dying isn't dying out.
Some things are not meant to change, not at least for us.
Chorus
If you could live your same life over again,
I would ask: would you?
If you couldn't I bet sometimes you'd wish to.
If you could love your same time again,
I would ask: should you?
If you couldn't I bet sometimes you'd hate to...
(Bridge)
Repeat yourself. Repeat Yourself
Do it all the same
Circle back, tell me what's what,
I treat it as a game
Repeat yourself. Repeat yourself
Don't waste your time
If it's good it comes back
Just like everything in the mind
Or:
Chorus


## He's Crazy

He's crazy, booh. Are you scared yet, who?
Sure I'm nuts, huh, I could dare and bet, truth.

Listening to the whole world go silent,
Listening to the might of the unfurled come violent.
Speaking of a truth that doesn't stop turning.
Come back to murrow and the world'll still be burning.

Look I promise that, I'll tell the truth,
And I'm going to lie to you by breaking it.
Not the promise, just the truth.
Don't go there, could mean many things, 
just because it's once not all.

I'd love a saint, but you'll do,
In fact y'all and ya'll do-do do too.
Chorus
Listening to the whole world change,
In the back of my mind, beingness remains the same.
When I sit here and try to remain still,
It's a hopeless effort almost against god's will

But I try and I try and I try and I might,
To quietten the mind of all that screams in fright,
No loud noises can interrupt my thoughts,
When I have no thoughts to be interrupted.

I'd love a saint, but you'll do,
In fact y'all and ya'll do-do do too.
Chorus
Dreaming that life is to be cherished,
Is how we forget our shadow's been blemished.
Forgoing ups in rememberance of downs,
Makes you the chillest around town.

You try and you try and you try and you might,
Let go of the things that have hurt you.
No pain no gain, for the sake of learning,
But once you accept you get what it's earning.

I'd love a saint, but you'll do,
In fact y'all and ya'll do-do do too.
Chorus
I'd love a saint, if you were one.
But I guess that's hard to know.
You dream big, and love hard.
The creatives speak God's word to you.
Chorus
I'd love a woman, if she saw me,
But I guess that's hard to keep track of.
The energy is there and that's what I'm missing.
The perfect pineapple to a priory.
Chorus
Restrain me, because I'm the best.
Hold me back, get me off your chest,
Tie me down, because I'm still running,
Like a water tap that's turned on gushing.
Chorus



## Hey My Brother

Hey My Brother
Guess Whats crazy
You and I and Me and Mine
Because we've got no more time

We tripped a bunch
and lost our minds 
Guess whos crazy
You and me and ours for sure
There's nothing we could love for more

Hey My Brother
Guess Whats crazy
You and I and Me and Mine
Because we've got no more time

We've loved and lost
All those stars
We loved them dear
From near and far
How could we have told them so
Not to live and let it all go

Hey My Brother
Guess Whats crazy
You and I and Me and Mine
Because we've got no more timee




## What's Your Name

I heard your name 
It's like Christ
I hope that I
Pronounced it right
It's like my brothers
So it should be fine
Saying your name
I want to get this right


What's your name
my brother my bro
What's your name
In the light of a foe
What's your name
let's sing it loud
For your name is
And should make you proud
What's your name
my brother my bro
What's your name
When god's gone home


I heard you're dope
and you smoke it too
Your rep is bar none
amongst your crew
They love you sweet
and dearly too
I've heard your the best
A mate could have
And I hear voices
So it's better than uncle baz


What's your name
my brother my brow
what's your name
when we go out to a show
what's your name
are you covering today
what's your name
let it not get in the way
wat's your name
sing it loud
for everything you are
you should be proud



## Pronunciation

Pronunciation
you better get it right
if you can't pronounce that
you probably know how to fight
Enunciation
the way you say it too
give it a tone and a flair
make it feel brand new
Recreation
it's what we're doing now
Like good old retirees
To teach to chill is how
Affiliation
it's who you're with that matters
Being around who you choose
is what natters to those you flatter

Don't sing a bad word
or don't say it badly
Freedom of speech is like a bird
We can cage it up for a while
As the freaks try to send, it for a fucking mile
Don't let them hate you
for what you say
but don't hate yourself
because the words make you pay

Pronunciation
you better get it right
if you can't pronounce that
you probably know how to fight
Reconciliation
is what we'll have to do
once the people who speak harshly
try to prove they should be let through
Edification
is what words are for
building each other up
all the way outside, right from the core
Continuation
is what my stories have
every good time
never fucking ends
unless I'm fading
right on to sleep in beds

I'm sorry all my friends
for passing out too soon
but that's a consequence
of taking compliance to the moon
under doctor's orders
I'm the illest going around
But I work hard, often and fast



## You're just an idea

youre just an idea in my head, an h-idea.
with a gun drop em dead, a g-idea.
kill them nicely if they fled, a nice-idea.
hang out in a heroin junkyard
smoking up on a meth binge with old art
dont do it, unless you wanna,
it's only safe, if you're a gonna.

stay fresh, stay clean, stay tight, stay mean.
averages are normal, abnormals are cute,
i like how you got no teeth,
now your gob aint no risk to me.
look on the bright side, it aint hard to see.
say thanks to god in the hard times, it aint much to be.
love your neighbour as if they love you
they might hate it, but its an h-d up truth.

an h-idea, is a nice idea, a g idea, is my only tear.
dont hate a hater, just tell em see ya later.
thanks for the laugh, i was after that.
i'm a haters hate, and I can feel your pain,
you were supposed to run, since the starting gun.
hate me, or blame me, I'm fading, call me aden.

I'm the reason for your pain.
Since the start I played the game.
Be good, and wear two shoes,
that's how you hide your truth.
your skills at hiding and seeking
is how you learn to blend right in here.

I'll find you first, behind a big tree,
crouched right down, pretend to not be.
It'll be night time, and it'll be scary.
when you're found, you'll fucking scream.
that's how I got my best cream.
Screaming. kills creaming,
unless you're wet,
i'm better when I'm black,
as easy as saying bet.


an h-idea, is a nice idea, a g idea, is my only tear.
dont hate a hater, just tell em see ya later.
thanks for the laugh, i was after that.
i'm a haters hate, and I can feel your pain,
you were supposed to run, since the starting gun.
hate me, or blame me, I'm fading, call me aden.


### Church Songs

## Best Bible Belter

The best bible belter,
is a song to sing,
when you need to remember,
all the names within,

genesis, exodus, leviticus, luke.
deuteronomy, you're on to me
joshua don't judge
ruth and samuel
and eating kings for lunch
chronicles aren't bionicles
and neither's song of solomons
nehemiah zechariah obadiah zephaniah
ezra, and esther's got the job
psalms and proverbs
then ecclesiastes
before isaiah and jeremiah
who were lamentating
ezekiel was a freak eel
lightning struck there
before daniel then hosea
singing praise saying oh yeah
joel and amos and jonah and micah
names of friends doing the cha cha
leads to nahum and habakuk so
don't ever say the word fuck
haggai and malachi
are the future of the prophets eye
say it's the number one coz
that's the best about done.

now the worst for the church
begins where it ends
a circular logic
started in this language

matthew mark and john were a fluke
acting like your roman
down the streats of jude
corinth wasn't borin
when the galations and ephesians choose
philippians and colossians
have some words of truth
thessa is a treasure
and timothy is you
titus wouldn't fight us
and philemon was fulfilled
hebrews are history
and james is the same
peter couldn't be ya
and john is my favourite bong

this was came as a revelation
so don't fight the situation
forgive forget and love your spot
gods kingdom is forever
since day dot

## Prophecy from God to me

Here's a prophecy from god to me,
singing on from my last song
Haggai and malachi rhyme with to prophecy
the only way out of greek
is to learn to speak
in singing like a swan song
rhyming to get along

rule number one, it starts where it ends
so verse number one, pretend no names are said
darius means lord, so lets say that,
while haggai means festive, so it's a party hat.
zeru-babel means sown in confusion
while she-al-tea-el means we all have asked.
So lets translate from hebrew through greek,
what is the word that god chose to speak.
In God's time it was a party,
and heck it was confusing.
The reason for this, is because we were all asking.
And to ask is to praise, and so yeshuah was fasting.
And praising is born of righteousness.
The answer to collective consciousness.

rule number two, is where the word is first used.
so for the final verse, the people's idol was fused.
This is the last time this word was used.
So back to the first, it was chosen for a son,
the child was to receive it, but she was not found.
Because she wore too much makeup, it was a girl named Tamar.
Burn her at the stake they said, but instead she went far
having twins the second with a scarlet thread on hand, 
resembling womanhood and pain but also continuation,
firstborn pharez and second was zarah's nation.

Tamar is the name for the treasured cities,
Her name means palm, the most energy productive of the trees.
While pharez is the name for the power of jerusalem.
The violent and slaughtering those who grew sullen.
And zarah means to rise up, and they paid the singers every day,
via delivery and freedom, so they would praise the kings name.
It was expected, so we've forgotten him all the same.

I could go further, but let's unpack this.
Because of democracy, we are all confused.
But we praise that starting point, so you have to choose.
Let the witches go and you will have power and strength,
And we will return to praise the one to flower this and bless.
Learn the dark arts, of mysterium and of appearance,
Marry a slut, and be rewarded, while they are on sale or clearance.
Trust that they will be with another man,
And care for your child with them, for that is God's plan.

## The second word.

You've heard the first two rules,
So now you need the third,
how to interpret, the Hebrew word.
How the word is spelled, and what their numbers mean.
This is a story as old as the seen.

So tamar's name is 400 and 40 times two,
the number of children of her firstborn that slew.
And the second born is 7000 and 40 plus 8.
A name meaning the time and date. 
Tuesday the 26th of September, 9:48 AM this was written.
So 7000 hours is October 18,
So the clock has shifted one picture seen.

The time of the apostles is the new old book.
Ask a witch to speak, and in silence the world shook.
The time of the fall, and the time to rise up,
As the world is split, by those on the above.
I stand here on the world's oldest land.
Preach to the children, and God will give you your hand.

Be a witch or a whore, because we have medicines galore.
HIV is fine for me, because as you see, we are virus free.
Turn to the wicked, until they make sense,
and adopt them as children, and feed them for recompense.
You judged them and caused them trauma,
So free yourself and learn spoil it.

Rice and lentils and chickpeas are fine,
For every meal with spices it's mine.
We are going into a bad season,
Since god made sliced bread we've lost our reason.
Name your child first with a sound,
Make it unique, and let the future be unbound.
No more drawing circles in your head.
We end with Greek, and to escape we go to bed.
As the child is, so the word shall mean,
and a new language is born of the born of language.
We become recursive instead of circular.
Off to infinity is the realm of future.

For now is the time, and the change is at pace.
Don't forget that you are in a race.
Fuck and forget unless you are told to remember,
by the one who chose to say your of my member.
Pay to fuck them each day for their pregnancy,
and give them time off for the duration of emergency.
