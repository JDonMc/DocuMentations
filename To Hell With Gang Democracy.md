To Hell With Gang Democracy. 8

Equal Rights Means no one person can tell another what to do.

An individual disagreement occurs on the level of individuals.

Just because an opinion is popular doesn't make it more likely to be true or right.

...whatever True or Right are. We could make True = if(something == 0) or True = if(something == 1).

Just because one says one and one says zero doesn't make one right and one wrong.

When I vote, I am voting for who will be my Legal Representative, organising a team of paperworkers to manage my finances and position on what I'm allowed to do.

If the Legal Representative truly represented me, he would allow me to be me, so perhaps I should just be me and be free.

The only me I should be free to be is one who doesn't conflict with other me's.

When in doubt, the one telling you how it is is wrong.

If voters had to secure a 99.95 % majority to do anything, my guess is that the 0.05% are the ones to follow.

Democracy is wrought with Self Defeat. To decide as to whether we should have a democracy takes a democracy.

And so, democracy will always be about deciding what a democracy is about.

Instead, perhaps democracy should be an intermediary for deciding the best course of action, already knowing the best course of action is not democracy. We've tried that one.

But clearly we couldn't have known democracy was going to perform badly without first voting on it. No vote for democracy will reach 100%, every idiot will vote for himself and that's who should represent them, idiots.

But if idiots are going to represent us, I would like to be my own self representing idiot. If I'm going to make a mistake I'm going to be responsible for it.
