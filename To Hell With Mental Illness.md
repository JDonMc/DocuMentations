Does a society that loves psychedelics and exploring avenues of their own minds consider any nook or cranny an old nanny rots her fanny in as needing to be managed?

Is that management good if it says "Oh, boy! You've really done it this time. You're Mentally Ill, we don't have a mental solution to this mental problem, only a physical solution." Crux of the question: Is it "mind over matter" or "matter over mind"? Yeah, I thought so.

If you know how to think correctly, why do you wait until someone is suicidal to deal with their problems? And even then, you won't deal with their problems.

Encouraging people to call the Mental Illness Hotline will increase the number of people who see it as a failed enterprise and will move on to the next stage.
