# Alive Right Now

No point rushing to get out of old knowledge to the new.

Inflation is a ticking time bomb.

There's always more room in eternity for God's children.

Everyone is technically Christian if they are on the same team and same level.

The only purpose in doing things is for the thing in itself.

# Respect Authority

Otherwise you'll never have any.
