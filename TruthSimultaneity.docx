Abstract—The nature of unsolvable problems depends on the kind of unsolvability. These problems cannot be solved; thus, they are not problems, rather they are constraints, or domains or ranges. Further, these problems are already solved upon creation, as they were not created, they arise as natural mathematical law as a result of axioms. The fears associated with Artificial Intelligence and its development to the point of superintelligence and beyond are dramatically under estimated, while simultaneously being inevitable. Thus, discussion in regard to these control ‘problems’ should be instead in regard to the control ‘situation’ and our responsibility in the continued management of AI tech knowledge.
Keywords—artificial intelligence; superintelligence; the control problem; unsolvability; control situation; global technology management; GAIA; MAIA
First off, this paper will discuss the nature of Truth capital T versus “other truths”, and the nature of simultaneity. For a given moment we can observe the inability to solve the 3 body problem as caused by the mathematics happening in 2 bodies can’t be projected into a triplet interaction set through step wise calculation, because which of the other 2 particles do you step through to first, because you get different answers each way. Then we will go on to suggest that this sentence can be interpreted in many ways, and each way has many potential proofs summarized by short lines of reasoning. Take, for example, absolutism. Does there exist any or any singular absolute truth, and is there a difference to be recognized for capital T Truth and lowercase ordinary truth. The former can be seen as godlike by many as implied by the capitalization, or perhaps as a living changing entity.

The first trick here is to recognize we have made no mention of space, no mention of time, and no mention of mathematics or geometry. Simply truth, existence, simultaneity, and a group of other truths. This are our initial primaries, and by quick assumption we can start off with a negative concept, or our zero point on the non-hierarchical flow-chart diagram. The first element in the set of potential truths we can suggest might follow this ideal is the idea of “non-creation” / “non-created” / “non-creating” / “non-creatable”. Take all of these as being outside of time, so no past tense, outside of space, so no place for action, no mathematics, so no structure involved, and no geometry, so no ability to apply an adjectival descriptor.
So instead of using these terms, we will use them all interchangeably as the conventional grammar requires it. Immediately we recognize a few things that must also exist simultaneous to this first zero-point on the flow-chart. As it is non-created it need not be declared or proved to exist. Now from here we can reason to simply take away from what we already have and so is birthed the next step on the hierarchy which is creation. These are taken to be capital T Truths of existence preceding any need for time. So it exists simultaneously in the past and in the present, meanwhile we sit here in the future attempting to describe what we’ve seen in both, until it becomes presented into past. Whenever that happens, but we’ll get to that as we go on. This is merely by following the chains of implication. When we suggest first there must exist an idea of non-creationable, or a category or set of objects which can fall under the idea of not being able to be created, we can move forward without addition and simply subtract the differences that start out obvious to us. As it is outside of time the flow-chart is non-heirarchical, it is drawn in order of appearance but really they are all implied by each other and so must exist simultaneously in the same moment, or, if you will, absolute existence. In absolute existence nothing changes nor has the time to change.

Finally the paper will go on to discuss the many implications that follow on in this same way simply by starting with what we’ve already drawn on paper as preliminary ideas (started without the need for proof and becoming able to be proved), that must exist inside a mind if it could first be shown to not naturally pre-exist a universe or space or time or as mentioned earlier.

What Did I mean when I stated this initial question?
I meant it in every way we could take it, so we could explore the potential for hyper-implied meaning starting from nothing without proof. These things are simply implied by the nature of having a mind and being able to observe it’s contents. Once we have a null idea we can see what categories of ideas it can imply through mutual conferrance, or by knowing what we mean when we use a word to signify a particular idea – to know thyself.

So we have the difference between capital T Truth, lowercase truth, a plurality of truths, and them in a group known as the other truths. Then we could also capitalise that and have Truths and/or Other Truths. In and out of mutual order. Comparing these as each separate and different ideas that might all exist simultaneously if only if only we knew what we meant when we said them.

What Did You think I meant when I stated this initial question?
I understand you think I’m saying that when we take a look at a scientific paper and it purports the truth, then it must be congruous and unifiable with the other scientific truths currently accepted, or for what you yourself accept. There are countless examples of this not being the case. And so we filter out the differences and use the powers of large numbers to try and control the data to dictate what is or is not the truth and what is or is not accepted.

Consensus reality may form around me with or without my consent. In a game of majority rules, a party of one never stands a chance. And that’s why I don’t trust any singular interpretation of the titular statement without it being taken with the explication of understanding what I meant when I said it.

So what do we mean when we say these ideas?
Consensus reality dictates that I am in submission to the whole and must incorporate every other person’s beliefs into my accepted worldview in order to continue participating in reality at what is becoming on a global scale. Inclusivity of all race creed and culture and belief, according to the lands you stand on or the waters you surf, up to you and your prerogative, ability to reason, justify, explain yourself, and convince others that you are in the right when you use the information that you can provide. But those I am in submission to need not justify anything of their beliefs and need not convince others that they deserve to have their own beliefs outside of consensus reality, when the same rules applied to the self can be applied to every other singular individual participating in this perceived consensus mechanism. So I must first admit my contentions with much of consensus, wishing to diverge, by starting again from a place of bedrock, ideas represented by words, and re-justify consensus reality back to itself so it can shut up and fuck off.

What we mean when we say Truth, truth, a plurality of truths, other truths, Truths and Other Truths? It is generally accepted that Truth represents either a universal grand equation, theory, or conclusion. Taken to mean ordered natural consequence, fact (vs the opinion of truth), or a collective totality that includes everything. Truths represents either many individual simple truths, everyone deserving the right to believe their own personal truth, or slightly more abstractly consensus on the collective of unifiable truths that exist simultaneously in the present dictating the laws of motion and everything else.

Other Truths is taken to mean either the collective of all others and what they hold as either Truth or Truths. Lowercase truth represents a diminished spirit and value for what we consider true, by it having being used anywhere and everywhere, and at the same time absolutely nowhere (because of it’s diminishment). Meanwhile truths is taken to mean a diminishment in either having too many truths to count and/or look through and/or find and/or determine, that the task is simply as insurmountable as considering someone else’s personal opinion as having any value above our own (declare war here). 

And finally other truths is taken to mean everything else I couldn’t be bothered to describe because it is not yet accepted in consensus reality. We have all of these options for a linear interpretation of truth, if we are supposed to accept consensus reality as representing the truth. Or other truths could just mean simply that, other truths (if you’d rather be Greek than Jewish or something (wait we’re not supposed to discuss this, as we are trying our best to accept and represent consensus reality)). The characteristics of a language dictates how we see ourselves, how others see us, and how we see others. To learn a foreign language is to attempt to adopt a foreign culture out of the appreciation of it’s flavour, perhaps find some more of that love, or if you really are at odds with yourself, to go and declare war on foreign nation states, collective groups, and, oh wait, consensus realities. This is where it all falls apart.


What is the nature of simultaneity?
Simultaneity exists in it’s own place and time outside of ours if that’s what you’d like to think and have enough others help to agree to. Simultaneity exists absolutely, for eternity, stretching throughout all it’s own causes and consequences as found by the implications seen within the mind. Simultaneity means that all change happens in the same moment at the same time and that for somethings can exist in the same place as each other. Simultaneity can have many attributes once it is taken as absolute and forever, we can have position simultaneity, we can have time simultaneity, we can have long simultaneity and short simultaneity. So for all criteria and attributes that break this cycle, they must be dropped and seen to exist simultaneously in some other place and time to the rest of what we are talking about here. 

Implications are made in the mind through intention, as we attach to the attributes we associate with the criteria of discussion. The first thing we think of when we say or read something is generally taken as the accepted interpretation and nothing more is said or done about it. This is the oversimplification of the century, nay, multitudes of millennia, and is what keeps us trapped by needing to conform to consensus by dictatorial rule. I could get by just by reading the same word over and over again knowing that my ideas of it changes as I change the way in which I say it. The implications of tonality suggests that when I say I want consensus reality to shut up and fuck off, I sound angry at it, meanwhile in truth I know it to already be the case. Otherwise it would have come to me and said something of itself to say what there is to know and nothing else be allowed. Instead we have belief, so you must accept me for I am a part of the most far reaching and strongest religion and religious influences. This is not something I was raised by, my family was excommunicated so it was my job to go to church on my own without assistance, and to learn that the ways taught to be an ideal person was to travel the lands and visit all the different churches and to learn from and question their leaders. This is why everyone questions religion now in favour of one or the other of their own beliefs from the readings they have been presented and have fed on, the people they have met and spoken too and learned from, the languages they have learned, the cultures they have lived amongst, or consensus reality. So what would you rather. Violate the rights of an individual, or adhere to a consensus reality? I wish to communicate to the consensus reality to tell them to go away because they are not allowed in. They never went to the religions and learned and challenged them. Because when you travel and challenge the leaders after having learned from them by simply asking a few honest questions in a gentle spirit, eventually because of the questions you ask it re-enforces in them a behaviour to try and fight back in self defence. 

And so, because of that I have angered God and wish for consensus reality to go away, because it continues to subvert me, co opt me, and try to destroy me. But I need to use it in order to tell it to go away. So by simply removing the need for everything they rely on, and taking things as being implied in the mind, the individual will regain it’s rights and the eagles of the east will soar.


From Non-creation to everything
If you don’t believe in a creator we can simply start from an idea and have the non-created truths, take the nearest association in our minds through collective pattern usage by utilising language, and boom, secondarily we have creation. Then we have uncreation, to remove from creation, and destruction, to belittle within creation. Once we have creation and uncreation, or creation and destruction, we have change, two types of change, being kicked from existing within consensus reality, or ordinary change that occurs within creation (outside of the absolute eternity of simultaneity, or the framework of implication from non-creation to everything). We also have balance (creation vs destruction ratios), and frequency (continuous change), and as we continue to imply these things in sequence, we can see the whole world of ideas exists from a single unique concept and what it implies in our minds. If that is the case, there is only language, and it’s implication, and the world within our minds. I can communicate well with consensus reality because I regularly have telepathy with the collective of others outside of myself for extended continuous periods where sharp downloads of information are passed to me, and a lot of weird change happens in my spirit and is reflected back on the external environment. I have seen forests grow bigger in the picture while the zoom doesn’t change and the leading physicist of the 12 seconds of fame is dictating that only objective fact, or only physical reality exists, or that consciousness is an illusion, or that computers can think for themselves (which I warned you about to the point of being committed for it, look who’s laughing now). I have made so many prophecies in my life that have all come true, that I now prophecy over an other’s life, their family, and their family’s partners and their childrens. I give them blessings and warnings for the future. And it’s all in the common tongue of consensus reality, and because they are there to hear it, it falls not on deaf ears. My influence has grown over the years and I’m not proud of needing to seek it out, but the resistance to a change of ways is what is holding us back from a fluidity of mind to accept and adopt from any culture, race and religion. Perform your vetting, ask questions and discern the truth from what you know. Never hold on to a single interpretation alone except for the ones implied.

When you can challenge the standards in place, and you are called perfect by your teachers, then you will know that you, the perfectionist have finally made it. And so now to learn how to present yourself well, so that you can have a lasting appearance, instead of just a forever dying influence, but an increasing one at that. People now seek me out for my skills to build businesses, because everything is immaterial now. We need no reality outside of our own minds. How does the psychoanalyst perform when he is split between a binary of objectivism (no feeling) and subjectivism (no truth), can’t reconcile any of the difficult problems facing science, and simply sits in his high chair to judge others for his own repressions and trauma. Imagine thinking it is acceptable to see a patient for 15 minutes and listen to a crowd of people who are paid to watch sit and say repeatedly “there’s something strange about this guy”, move that to “he’s abnormal” and you’ve got yourself a strong potion. 

People crave normalcy. They want everything to be a single dot on the screen so it’s simple and easy and easily repeatable. You can just make your towel hang symmetrically, and your curtains look nice. You can just spend your days trading away your time for money, and selling your soul to someone who is making more from you than you make yourself. How is that ever going to make sense. No. People come to me, ask me to build their business, and so I offer to build it for them as long as I get a cut. I don’t have a lot of success in making money, because the last guys I fucked over worked with and for the FBI and the blah blah blah other 3 letter agencies on a list on a list. 

They asked me to build their business in exchange for cash, but at least they were honest and said they already valued the business at 300 million dollars, and valued me at 70k and 0.75% shares when I get it done. I played the game as long as it took to realise the guy didn’t know how to manage his time effectively, nor how to make quick decisions, nor how to not double handle information, nor how to do anything of value himself, nor nor nor. He just had power, because his sister loved a cunning linguist, and he worked for her. There were so many other serious wrongs that occurred that I stopped my work and hung out with the locals. This guy travelled the world to find me, and his only citation of respect was his sister’s connection to Noam Chomsky. 

They’ll make a great business if they know what they are doing. They wouldn’t need to if they divulged every secret about the technologies available behind the scenes. With the amount of code I can copy from my other databases I could make their business in 2 weeks, but I only work for people 1 hour a week, so I guess it will have to wait. He had money, I had skills, and I threw his money away, and took my skills with me. So I guess it was the best job I’ve ever had. Wasting time for money. I’d give that up in a flash. And the ease and power of doing things gets easier by the minute, and yet everyone else does less by the day. The amount of times I hear “you work a lot”, when it’s only an hour a week. Is that not a different level of efficiency? 

I have time management skills better than my boss who always tells me he doesn’t have the time to do certain jobs so that’s why he’s getting me to do them. I’m sorry, if you don’t have the time for it, I don’t have the care to do it for you unless it benefits me. You want it done, right? So get out there and do it. It’s not hard. That was my first job out of university, hey build the FBI’s new database that we already value at 300 million and we’ll give you none of it. You knew I was going to fuck you over. I now get offered 51% by the people that seek me out, and I do the labor for free. Isn’t that a better exchange for me? My businesses aren’t worth anything to anyone but myself and the people asking for my help. 

So who do I help? Consensus reality? Or a lone instrument. And what happens, do I sign away my service to keeping government and private secrets? Or do I keep my own and leave you all hanging out for a better paper to read? You all crave the next thing of interest, and if any of the start of this paper was interesting, then perhaps you should learn what I mean by it.

I write a one sentence disclaimer for an unpublished paper, and get all these requests for publication. So I made it up, like the rest of you. Now fuck off.
